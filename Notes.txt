1. There are 16 rows in the dataset for which the value of store ratio is 0 and all of them have a popularity of 0. Based on this hypothesis we assume that all the rows in the test dataset that have a store ratio value of 0 belong to the '0' popularity class.

2. Two outliers in the time column having values > 2*1e6
3. One outlier in class 1 with store ratio > 0.9
4. 3 outliers in test dataset having store score >0
